1. Authentication using API Key
For OpenAI API Endpoints, deploy the Model to generate the endpoint URL and an API key to authenticate against the service. In this sample endpoint and key are strings holding the endpoint URL and the API Key.

The API endpoint URL and API key can be found on the Deployments + Endpoint page once the model is deployed.

To create a client with the OpenAI SDK using an API key, initialize the client by passing your API key to the SDK's configuration. This allows you to authenticate and interact with OpenAI's services seamlessly:

import os
from openai import AzureOpenAI

client = AzureOpenAI(
    api_version="2024-12-01-preview",
    azure_endpoint="https://adiletai-openai.openai.azure.com/",
    api_key=subscription_key
)

2. Install dependencies
Install the Azure Open AI SDK using pip (Requires: Python >=3.8):

pip install openai

3. Run a basic code sample
This sample demonstrates a basic call to the chat completion API. The call is synchronous.

import os
from openai import AzureOpenAI

endpoint = "https://adiletai-openai.openai.azure.com/"
model_name = "gpt-5-mini"
deployment = "gpt-5-mini"

subscription_key = "<your-api-key>"
api_version = "2024-12-01-preview"

client = AzureOpenAI(
    api_version=api_version,
    azure_endpoint=endpoint,
    api_key=subscription_key,
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "I am going to Paris, what should I see?",
        }
    ],
    max_completion_tokens=16384,
    model=deployment
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

Run a multi-turn conversation
This sample demonstrates a multi-turn conversation with the chat completion API. When using the model for a chat application, you'll need to manage the history of that conversation and send the latest messages to the model.

import os
from openai import AzureOpenAI

endpoint = "https://adiletai-openai.openai.azure.com/"
model_name = "gpt-5-mini"
deployment = "gpt-5-mini"

subscription_key = "<your-api-key>"
api_version = "2024-12-01-preview"

client = AzureOpenAI(
    api_version=api_version,
    azure_endpoint=endpoint,
    api_key=subscription_key,
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "I am going to Paris, what should I see?",
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Paris, the capital of France, is known for its stunning architecture, art museums, historical landmarks, and romantic atmosphere. Here are some of the top attractions to see in Paris:\n\n1.

        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is so great about #1?",
        }
    ],
    max_completion_tokens=16384,
    model=deployment
